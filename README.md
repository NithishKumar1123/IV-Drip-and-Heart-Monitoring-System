# IV-Drip-and-Heart-Monitoring-System
This paper presents an introduction of numerous gadgets in the medical profession that had a significant impact on the interdisciplinary monitoring of bodily functions like blood pressure, heart rate, heart attack symptoms, and much more. The value of the healthcare system is rising right now. The suggested device automatically notifies the nurse using GSM technology when the IV fluid level drops below a certain level. On the liquid crystal display, a continuous monitoring system continuously shows the patient's blood pressure and heart rate (LCD). Instead of constantly monitoring an IV fluid system, this technology decreases the workload of the nurse. As intravenous (IV) fluid is typically supplied in crowded operating rooms (ORs) using the gravity-fed IV administration technique rather than an infusion pump, IV bags often empty unnoticed. Intravenous Drip and Heart Monitoring System is used mainly in hospitals for patients who were dehydrated, nutrient deficient or unable to take medications orally.
